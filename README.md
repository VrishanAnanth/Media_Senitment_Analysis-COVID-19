# Media_Senitment_Analysis-COVID-19

In this NLP based project, we aim to see if media reaction and pressure affects the State government in their performance, particularly, their efficiency in handling
the pandemic in their respective states

I scraped all the tweets of relevant national and regional media strongholds of all their tweets, and sort them into the tweets related to govt. performance and how
they deliver news related to COVID-19, and we run an analysis. We use NLP algorithms to get a scoring method for reaction types, and pressure on government and 
run a regression on state performance (mortality rate, no of beds available, testing rates)

I did this project during my internship at the Indian School of Business
